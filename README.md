üöÄ Welcome to my Space!

I'm Kai, also known as `lambiengcode`, currently steering the tech ship at Waterbus as a TechLead. My playground revolves around code, and I'm here to share the excitement with you. Have a tech question? Hit me up at lambiengcode@gmail.com or telegram: [lambiengcode](https://t.me/lambiengcode).

I'm really interested in WebRTC and that is main reason I kick off [Waterbus](https://github.com/lambiengcode/waterbus) is an open source project for curious and experimental, it's try to apply some interesting features related to VoIP. I bet you can find something there.

Feel free to explore my repositories and join me on this exciting coding journey. ‚ú®
